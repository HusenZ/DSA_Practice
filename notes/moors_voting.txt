Core Intuition: Vote & Cancel
Think of it like this:

Every element is casting a vote.

You keep track of a candidate who might win (majority).

If another number shows up, it’s like voting against the current candidate.

If the count of current candidate's votes becomes zero, drop it and pick a new candidate.

🔁 Step-by-Step Walkthrough
Imagine this list:
[3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]

We’ll:

Start with no candidate.

As we move through, we “vote”:

Same number as candidate → increase count

Different number → decrease count

If count hits 0 → replace candidate

At the end:

The candidate left is our potential majority.


Key Rules of the Algorithm (n/3 version)
There can be at most two elements that appear more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.

You need two candidate variables and their counts.

Step 1: Find candidates (not guaranteed correct, only potential).

Step 2: Verify them by counting again.
Final Concept Template (Not Code):
Track 2 candidates and their counts.

If current matches candidate → increase count.

Else if count is 0 → assign new candidate.

Else → reduce both counts.

Then, verify if those candidates appear > n/3 times.
