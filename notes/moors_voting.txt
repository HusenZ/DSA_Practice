Core Intuition: Vote & Cancel
Think of it like this:

Every element is casting a vote.

You keep track of a candidate who might win (majority).

If another number shows up, it’s like voting against the current candidate.

If the count of current candidate's votes becomes zero, drop it and pick a new candidate.

[3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]

We’ll:

Start with no candidate.

As we move through, we “vote”:

Same number as candidate → increase count

Different number → decrease count

If count hits 0 → replace candidate

At the end:

The candidate left is our potential majority.
